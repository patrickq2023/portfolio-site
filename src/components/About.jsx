      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        Hello! My name isPatrick, (my friends call me pq) and I'm a London based Junior Software Engineer. 
      </p>
      <p>
      Transitioning from a lifelong career as a professional photographer and business owner, I sought a change of direction. 
      Prompted by a friend to explore the Software Engineering Course at General Assembly, I enrolled to embark on a new journey. 
      I was immediately intrigued by software engineering, and the opportunity that gave me to acquire new skills and implement 
      them in conjunction with my existing ones in an ever evolving sector. My aspiration is to contribute as part of a collaborative 
      team dedicated to working on exciting projects, creating web applications and software that are both innovative and offer a 
      positive user experience.
       With a background in the creative industry, I bring a keen eye for detail that positions me well for success as a software engineer. 
       Whether taking direction or leading a team, I am dedicated to delivering solid results that satisfy clients. My ability 
       to adapt and contribute is complimented by a friendly and easy going manner. Motivated and hungry to build my skill set, I am 
       enthusiastic about roles that foster both personal growth and meaningful contribution.

      </p>
