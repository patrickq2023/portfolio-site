      <p>Hello! My name is Patrick, my friends call me pq, I'm a London based Junior Software Engineer.</p>
      <p>Transitioning from a lifelong career as a professional photographer and business owner, I sought a change of direction. 
      Prompted by a friend to explore the Software Engineering Course at General Assembly, I enrolled to embark on a new journey. 
      I was immediately intrigued by software engineering, and the opportunity that gave me to acquire new skills and implement 
      them in conjunction with my existing ones in an ever evolving sector. My aspiration is to contribute as part of a collaborative 
      team dedicated to working on exciting projects, creating web applications and software that are both innovative and offer a 
      positive user experience.
       With a background in the creative industry, I bring a keen eye for detail that positions me well for success as a software engineer. 
       Whether taking direction or leading a team, I am dedicated to delivering solid results that satisfy clients. My ability 
       to adapt and contribute is complimented by a friendly and easy going manner. Motivated and hungry to build my skill set, I am 
       enthusiastic about roles that foster both personal growth and meaningful contribution.</p>
      <p>Please take a look at my projects and if you like what you see please feel free to get in touch.</p>

      <p>Outside of work I have plenty of other interests including travelling, enjoying great food, Formula1 and snowboarding. 
        I love to keep fit and am a very keen triathlete, but my one true love is cycling. I serve as Road Captain on the 
        committee of my local cycling club, coordinating and planning club rides, and ride out with them at least twice a week. 
        My favourite pastime has got to be travelling abroad with my bike, exploring new places and challenges, sampling local delicacies 
        and pastries along the way, not to mention stopping to take some beautiful photographs (a bicycle can take you to some amazing 
        places). I have competed in 4 Ironmans in Europe and loads of smaller races here at home and scaled some of the iconic climbs 
        of the Tour de France and the Giro dâ€™Italia.</p> 
      <p>Feel free to have a look at my personal Instagram to view a few of my adventures.</p>
